"""Emit ``sync_run.completed`` and ``sync_run.failed`` webhooks on SyncJob terminal transitions.

Issue #463: the storefront UI proxied by agentic-api wants push notifications
when a tenant's inventory / custom_targeting / advertisers sync finishes —
without polling, and without depending on a managed-tenant scheduler keeping
state in sync. The catalog originally declared ``sync.completed`` /
``sync.failed`` but no emission point was wired; PR #465 wired emission and
renamed the events to ``sync_run.*`` to match the ``<entity>.<verb-past>``
catalog convention (the entity is the SyncJob row, surfaced as
``data.sync_run_id``).

Architecture: ``_capture`` (before_flush) collects snapshots into a thread-safe
queue. ``_flush`` (after_commit) moves them from the SQLAlchemy session into
the queue — that's all the work it does in-line. A background dispatcher
thread polls the queue and does the actual DB lookup + delivery. This is
critical for CI safety (#76424016996): if the listener did DB work in-line
under after_commit, a daemon thread racing the integration_db fixture's
``engine.dispose()`` would raise :class:`OperationalError` through
``session.commit()``, trip the ``_is_healthy=False`` circuit breaker in
``get_db_session``, and cascade-fail every subsequent test in the 10s
breaker window. Deferring to a separate thread completely isolates emission
from the committing session.

Sync runs reach a terminal state from 15+ call sites (background workers,
adapter sync managers, admin endpoints, repository helpers). Sprinkling
``emit_event(...)`` at each site is the brittle pattern PR #457 explicitly
avoided. Instead, this module registers a SQLAlchemy session listener that
fires once per actual commit of a ``SyncJob`` row transitioning to
``completed`` or ``failed``. Same template as
``src.services.webhook_signing``'s credential-cache invalidator.

Layering:

* ``before_flush`` — snapshot the SyncJob fields needed for the payload
  while the ORM instance is still attached and its attribute history is
  available. Stash snapshots on ``session.info``.
* ``after_commit`` — drain the stash and call
  :func:`src.admin.services.webhook_publisher.emit_event` for each.
  Webhook delivery is observability, so failures here MUST NOT propagate
  back into the sync worker that just succeeded.
* ``after_rollback`` — drop the stash. A rolled-back terminal write
  should not emit an event.

The listener is idempotent and registered at module import.
