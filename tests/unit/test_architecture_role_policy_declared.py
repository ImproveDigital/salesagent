"""Guard: every tenant-scoped mutation route declares an RBAC role policy.

Sprint 4 / role enforcement. Closed-by-default in
``require_tenant_access`` already protects mutations (a route without
``role=`` requires admin), but explicit declaration makes intent
visible at the call site and forces every new route author to think
about the policy choice. This guard catches anything missing.

A "mutation route" is any tenant-scoped route handler whose
``methods=`` contains POST, PUT, DELETE, or PATCH. The guard scans
each blueprint AST and asserts the ``@require_tenant_access(...)``
decorator on the handler explicitly contains ``role=``.

Allowlist exists for legitimate exceptions (auth-flow handlers that
must be reachable without auth, or routes already migrated to a
different decorator). Each entry has a comment justifying why.
