"""Regression test: ``MockSellerPlatform.sync_creatives`` must persist
to the database via the shared delegate.

Issue #88: the e2e ``test_creative_sync_with_assignment_in_single_call``
fails at "Creative <id> should be in list" — sync claims
action=created, but the subsequent list_creatives call doesn't return
it. Trace: the mock's ``sync_creatives`` was a stub that fabricated
``action="created"`` without writing to the DB; ``list_creatives``
delegates properly to the impl which reads from the DB → finds
nothing.

Same defect class as the ``get_media_buy_delivery`` mock stub fixed in
PR #84 / issue #54: a placeholder method shipping success-shaped wire
output without performing the actual side-effect. Sync and list use
the same DB scope, so the integration test in PR #96 passes (impl-level
flow is correct); the e2e symptom comes from the mock's stub.

Fix: make the mock dispatch to ``_delegate_sync_creatives`` so it
goes through the same impl GamPlatform uses (real DB write).
